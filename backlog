Detection of disconnected 1-wire => error

----------------

OneWire: getTempC takes 12ms. Time is spent in OneWire communication (reset, read, etc.).
However, it does not block interruptes for more than 480us, so it should be ok.
However, light is blinking when reading temp, so something is going on.

Disconnect WiFi: crashes => update library => issue with STL => Update toolchain => Install dev-env properly

Driving inductive load (snubber)

Test crashes

Check interrupts

Real PID + Relay

----------------

Avoid problems when logging temperature

Block interrupts, cleanup variables

Use timer1 interrupts: http://onetechpulse.com/esp8266-microsecond-delay-timer/

Integrate over the sinus curve to determine actual energy

----------------

Ensure temperature and log in /var/www/log does not grow too much

Control commands via http

Read target temperature from web server
Log target temperature
